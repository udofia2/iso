Based on the discussions so far, here's a list of potential components for your React portfolio app:

**Essential Components:**

* **App.js:** The main application component, responsible for wrapping your application with `ChakraProvider` (for theme) and optionally `BrowserRouter` (for routing).
* **NotFound.js:** A component displayed for unmatched routes, handling 404 errors.
* **RepoList.js:** A component responsible for displaying a list of your repositories with pagination functionalities.
* **RepoItem.js:** A component responsible for displaying information and a link for each individual repository within the `RepoList`.
* **SingleRepo.js:** A component for rendering detailed information about a specific repository, displayed when a user clicks on an item from `RepoList`.

**Bonus Components (Optional):**

* **Modal.js:** A component for creating a modal dialog to handle creating new repositories.
* **CreateRepoForm.js:** A component for building the form within the modal for creating new repositories.
* **EditRepoForm.js:** A component for building the form for editing details of an existing repository (if implemented).

**Additional Considerations:**

* You might create additional components for specific sections of your portfolio content (e.g., About Me, Skills, Contact).
* You can further break down components into smaller, reusable ones for better organization.

Remember, this list is a suggestion based on the provided requirements. You can customize it based on your specific needs and desired functionalities for your portfolio application.





## Building a React Portfolio App with GitHub API Integration

This guide outlines the steps to build a React web app using the GitHub API to showcase your repositories with features like pagination, search/filter, nested routes, error handling, and a well-designed UI.

**Technology Stack:**

* Frontend: React
* Styling: You can choose from Tailwind, vanilla CSS, CSS Modules, or Styled Components.
* UI Library (Optional): Consider using Chakra UI, React-Aria, or ShadCN for faster development.
* Hosting: Netlify or Vercel

**Features:**

* Page listing all repositories with pagination (20 points)
* Bonus: Search and filter functionality (bonus points)
* Nested routes to display individual repository details (10 points)
* Error Boundary and 404 page for graceful error handling (10 points)
* Accessible and visually appealing UI (10 points)

**Bonus (Instructor Award of Recognition):**

* Modal for creating a new repository
* Edit details of the newly created repository
* Delete repository functionality

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Project Setup:**
    * Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
    * Install necessary dependencies: `axios` (for API calls), `react-router-dom` (for routing), and your chosen UI library (optional).

2. **GitHub API Integration:**
    * Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub ([https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)).
    * Implement API calls using `axios` to fetch your public repositories with pagination.
    * Utilize the `search/repositories` endpoint for search and filter functionality (optional).

3. **Components:**
    * Create a `RepoList` component to display all repositories with pagination.
    * Design a `RepoItem` component for each repository card with details and a link to the single repo page.
    * Develop a `SingleRepo` component to render details of a specific repository using nested routes.

4. **Error Handling:**
    * Implement an `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and display error messages gracefully.
    * Create a custom 404 page for handling non-existent routes.

5. **UI and Accessibility:**
    * Style your components using your preferred styling method.
    * Ensure proper accessibility practices like semantic HTML, appropriate ARIA attributes, and color contrast.

6. **Bonus Features (Optional):**
    * Implement a modal component for creating new repositories.
    * Utilize GitHub's REST API for creating, updating, and deleting repositories (requires additional permissions in the access token).
    * Consider using a library like `react-modal` for managing the modal state.

7. **Deployment:**
    * Push your code to a GitHub repository.
    * Host your application on Netlify or Vercel.
    * Submit the deployed application URL for grading.

8. **Documentation:**
    * Create a `README.md` file outlining the project setup, functionalities, deployment instructions, and any relevant notes.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use state management libraries like Redux or Context API for complex data management, especially with the bonus features.
* Implement unit tests to ensure code quality and maintainability.
* Explore GitHub API documentation for detailed information on available endpoints and functionalities ([https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28](https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28)).

Remember, this is a high-level guide. Research and explore resources to implement each feature effectively. By following these steps and incorporating your creativity, you can build a fantastic portfolio showcasing your skills and GitHub projects!
